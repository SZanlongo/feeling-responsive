Mobile, robust triage system for remote locations.

A set of 3 iPads are used to:
- register/check-in patients via name or fingerprint
- update patient records
- receive prescriptions

iPads and medical records are kept in sync through a local server run off a MacBook Air.

Local server can also synchronize with an off-site cloud server which can handle multiple locations.
