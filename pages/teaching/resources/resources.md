### Version Control
I find that a lot of students carry their code on a thumb drive. This is acceptable for Programming I and II, however you will find that this becomes unwieldy for more complicated projects. GitHub has a great [list of reasons](https://education.github.com/) to use version control. Below are some recommendations:

##### Repositories
These are the places that will host your code:

- [GitHub](https://education.github.com/) is best for showing off public work. You can also grab an [academic license](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) which gives you 5 private repos.
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) provides unlimited private repos for free, and also allows for self-hosting.
- [Bitbucket](https://blog.bitbucket.org/2012/08/20/bitbucket-academic/) provides unlimited private repos for free.

##### git Tutorials
- The [Atlassian Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) are quite well-written, and cover a variety of topics pertaining to git.

##### git Clients
Getting started with git can be daunting, and many people prefer using a GUI.

- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) for Linux, OSX, and Windows.
- [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for OSX and Windows.
- [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/) for Linux, OSX, and Windows

##### More git-Related Stuff
- Every project should be accompanied by a good [README](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2) and appropriate [.gitignore](https://www.gitignore.io/).
- [git-Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is probably one of the most common branching strategies. Very useful when working in teams, and even for individual projects.

### Microsoft
- [ShopUTS](https://shoputs.fiu.edu/login.php) allows FIU students to get a free copy of Microsoft Office
- [Microsoft DreamSpark](http://fiu-scis.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx) allows FIU CIS students to get a free copy of which has Microsoft Windows, Visual Studio, etc.
