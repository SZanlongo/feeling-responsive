Depending on your class, you will use either [SCIS Moodle](https://moodle.cis.fiu.edu/) or [Blackboard](http://online.fiu.edu/) to submit assignments and receive grades and feedback.

### Moodle
Your login information is initially set to your FIU/Panthersoft user ID. If your name is John Doe, and your ID is 1234567; then your login is:

    Username: FIU username (jdoe001)
    Password: FIU ID (1234567)

### Blackboard
Your login information is initially set to your FIU MyAccounts login:

    Username: MyAccounts username (jdoe001)
    Password: MyAccounts password

### Uploading Assignments
You can only upload one file to Moodle/Blackboard. Since programs can consist of multiple files, you will upload a compressed "zip" file using the [appropriate format](/teaching/submitting/).
