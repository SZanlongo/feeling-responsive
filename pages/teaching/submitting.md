You can only upload a single file. Programs will consist of multiple files, so you must upload a compressed "zip" file.

- Before creating the zip file, ensure that your program meets all the specifications and your output is correct.
- Save or copy your output to a text file.
- Create a folder with the following format: *LastnameFirstname-AssignmentX*. For example: `JohnDoe-Assignment3`
- Copy *only* your .java files and output to this folder.
- Right-click the folder, and choose **Send to** and then **Compressed (zipped) Folder**
- Upload to SCIS Moodle](https://moodle.cis.fiu.edu/v2.1/)
