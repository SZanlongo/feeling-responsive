### Homework Assignments
Completed assignments must be [uploaded to Moodle](/teaching/login/) using the [correct format](/teaching/submitting/)

### Lab Assignments
Lab assignments are not submitted through Moodle. Instead, print the lab-sheet and bring it to the lab. Here you will follow the instructions and fill in the sheet. At the end of each lab, the lab-sheets will be collected. **If I do not receive the lab-sheet at the end of the lab, that session will be counted as a 0.**

### Assignment Affirmation
Ensure that the internal program documentation at the top of each file includes:

- Name
- Section Number
- Affirmation: *I affirm that this program is entirely my own work and none of it is the work of any other person.*

### Integrity of Program and Output
Submitting an assignment requires that:

- The output is exactly that produced by the program.
- The source code is the exact version of the program that produced the output.

Submitting falsified output constitutes academic misconduct and will not be tolerated.
